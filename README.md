# AKSNetCoreSampleApp
Sample .net core app with steps to deploy to AKS. 

The goal is for this to be a sample app deployed via helm to AKS. 
I want steps from after you have an azure sub to deployed in public azure with monitoring and alerting on top.

TODO:
Add simple .net core service that connects to cosmosDB
Add Helm chart for deploying the service and database 
Add steps to add RG and create AKS cluster in it
Add steps to deploy service/db via helm
Add steps to update service
Add configuration for monitoring the service
Add Helm chart to deploy monitoring daemon set
